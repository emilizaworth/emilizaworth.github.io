My name is Emily Worthington. I recently graduated from The University of Texas at Austin with a BA degree in Internationl Relations and Global Studies. I started working full-time with MakerSquare in April. In my free time, I am playing with my dog Imogene, getting in a good work out, dancing at Barbarella, or traveling across the state.
