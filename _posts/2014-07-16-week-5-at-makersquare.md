Well, I've made it this far.

It's week 5 and, I won't lie, it has been difficult to stay on track. I'm pushing through and hoping to gain some really valuable skills. I have no doubts. The instructors here at MakerSquare are very talented and eager to teach what they know. I've noticed what I've enjoyed most has been the more design driven assignments. So, I'm going to aim to make this blog very pretty. We'll see how it goes.
